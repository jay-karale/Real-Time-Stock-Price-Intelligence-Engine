# Real-Time-Stock-Price-Intelligence-Engine
A real-time stock price intelligence engine implemented in C++ using advanced data structures. Supports streaming analytics, statistical indicators, anomaly detection, and simplified trade matching to mirror real exchange behavior.

📈 Real-Time Stock Price Intelligence Engine

A **C++ data-structure–driven project** that simulates **real-time stock price analysis and trade execution**.  
This project is designed to demonstrate how **core DSA concepts are applied in real financial systems** such as stock exchanges and trading platforms.

---

🚀 Project Objective

- Learn how real-world systems handle **continuous streaming data**
- Apply **DSA concepts** to solve practical problems efficiently
- Simulate **stock market analytics and order matching** at a learning scale
- Build a **placement-oriented project** that showcases problem-solving and system design skills

---

🧠 Key Features

- 🔄 **Real-time stock price streaming**
- 📊 **Highest & Lowest price tracking** using heaps
- ⚖️ **Real-time median calculation** using two-heaps approach
- ⏳ **Sliding-window median** for recent price analysis
- 📈 **Moving averages (SMA & EMA)** for trend detection
- 📉 **Volatility analysis** using statistical measures
- 🚨 **Anomaly detection** for sudden price spikes or drops
- 🏦 **Order Book Simulation**
  - Buy & Sell order placement
  - Automatic order matching (exchange-style logic)
  - Live order book view
